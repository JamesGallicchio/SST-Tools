# SST-Tools
A suite of tools and code designed to provide digital support for SST, the writing system of the constructed language Vo'Zaken.

## Goals
1. Specify encoding for Vo'Zaken (think ASCII)
2. Specify font format for SST (think OTF/TTF)
3. Implement text rendering of encoded Vo'Zaken with any given font
4. Provide a GUI tool for writing, reading, editing, storing, and rendering Vo'Zaken
5. Provide a GUI tool to manually construct fonts from smaller images

## Progress
[x] .vzk file format with encoding specs
[x] .sst font format with encoding specs
[ ] Rendering code to generate images of text
[ ] GUI Vo'Zaken "text editor"
[ ] GUI tool to build/edit fonts
[ ] Documentation of proposed standards
